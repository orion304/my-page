   - Eliminate need for mouse clicks during practice

### Short-term Goals
1. **Expand vocabulary data**: Incorporate all 60 lessons worth of ASL vocabulary into the trainer
2. **Lesson tracking**: Implement system to track which lessons have been completed/learned
3. **Progressive lesson unlock**: Add ability to add words from the next lesson into the active word pool
4. **Review mode**: Create a review feature for learned vocabulary
   - Option to review X random words from learned set
   - Option to review all learned words

### Stretch Goals
1. **Spaced repetition system (SRS)**: Implement algorithm to schedule reviews based on retention (like Anki)
   - Words you struggle with appear more frequently
   - Words you know well appear less often
   - Optimal learning efficiency

| ʮ | Apical vowel (syllabic fricative) | Extension of the "r" sound (retroflex position) |

## Chao Tone Letters

Tones are represented using IPA tone letters (Chao tone letters). These are language-agnostic and describe the actual pitch contour, making them useful across all tonal languages.

### The Five Tone Letters

| Letter | Level | Description | Input Shortcuts |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| ˥ | 5 | Extra high tone | `t5` or `!5` |
| ˦ | 4 | High tone | `t4` or `!4` |
| ˧ | 3 | Mid tone | `t3` or `!3` |
| ˨ | 2 | Low tone | `t2` or `!2` |
| ˩ | 1 | Extra low tone | `t1` or `!1` |

### Mandarin Chinese Tone Examples

Mandarin tones are represented using combinations of these letters:

| Mandarin Tone | Name | IPA Representation | Pitch Contour |
|---------------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| First tone (1st) | High level | ˥˥ | High and flat (55) |
| Second tone (2nd) | Rising | ˧˥ | Mid to high (35) |
| Third tone (3rd) | Dipping | ˨˩˦ | Low dipping (214) |
| Fourth tone (4th) | Falling | ˥˩ | High to low (51) |
| Neutral tone | Light/unstressed | (unmarked) | No fixed pitch |

**Example**: The word 你好 (nǐ hǎo) in IPA is `/ni˨˩˦ xɑʊ˨˩˦/`

### Input Shortcuts

**Mandarin-Specific Shortcuts (Easiest)**:
In the Chinese trainer, you can type Mandarin tone numbers (1-4) directly after a syllable, and it will automatically convert to the correct Chao tone letter combination:
- Type `ni3` → converts to `ni˨˩˦` (3rd tone)
- Type `xau3` → converts to `xɑʊ˨˩˦` (3rd tone)
- Type `ka1` → converts to `kʰa˥˥` (1st tone)
- Type `fu2` → converts to `fu˧˥` (2nd tone)

**Language-Agnostic Shortcuts**:
For more control, or when learning other tonal languages, use individual tone letters:
- Type tone letters: `ni t2 t1 t4` → `ni˨˩˦`
- Or use the `!` prefix: `ni !2 !1 !4` → `ni˨˩˦`

The Mandarin-specific shortcuts are faster for Chinese, while the language-agnostic approach works for any tonal language.

## Common Combinations

### Finals with /n/ and /ŋ/

- **-an** /an/ - Like "on" in "John"
- **-en** /ən/ - Like "un" in "fun"
- **-ang** /ɑŋ/ - Like "ong" in "song" but with "ah" vowel
- **-eng** /əŋ/ - Like "ung" in "sung"
- **-ing** /iŋ/ - Like "ing" in "sing"
- **-ong** /uŋ/ - Like "oo" in "moon" + "ng"

### Retroflex Endings

- **-er** /ɚ/ - Like American English "er" in "teacher"

## Tips for Learning Chinese IPA

1. **Aspiration matters**: The difference between p/pʰ, t/tʰ, k/kʰ is crucial in Mandarin. Hold your hand in front of your mouth - aspirated consonants should produce a strong puff of air.

2. **Retroflex vs. alveolo-palatal**: Mandarin distinguishes sh (ʂ), zh (ʈʂ) from x (ɕ), j (tɕ). The first set has tongue curled back, the second is more fronted.

3. **The "ü" sound**: The vowel /y/ is like saying "ee" with rounded lips. Practice: say "ee", keep tongue position, round your lips.

4. **Apical vowels**: The vowels /ɨ/ and /ʅ/ are unique to Mandarin. They're the "buzzing" continuation of the consonant before them.

5. **Neutral tone**: The fifth tone (⁵) is light and unstressed, often much shorter than other syllables.

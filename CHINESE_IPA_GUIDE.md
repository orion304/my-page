## Tips for Learning Chinese IPA

1. **Aspiration matters**: The difference between p/pʰ, t/tʰ, k/kʰ is crucial in Mandarin. Hold your hand in front of your mouth - aspirated consonants should produce a strong puff of air.

2. **Retroflex vs. alveolo-palatal**: Mandarin distinguishes sh (ʂ), zh (ʈʂ) from x (ɕ), j (tɕ). The first set has tongue curled back, the second is more fronted.

3. **The "ü" sound**: The vowel /y/ is like saying "ee" with rounded lips. Practice: say "ee", keep tongue position, round your lips.

4. **Apical vowels**: The vowels /ɨ/ and /ʅ/ are unique to Mandarin. They're the "buzzing" continuation of the consonant before them.

5. **Neutral tone**: The fifth tone (⁵) is light and unstressed, often much shorter than other syllables.
